1. Ease to develop (for developers)
    a. Python: Pre - defined libraries require less intensive coding to visualize data.
    b. Tableau: Easy to build dashboards with drag and drop facility. Can work with data from different data sources.
    c. D3: It is difficult due to intensive coding and tedious data processing
    
2. Ease to maintain the visualization (for developers)
    a. Python: Built in visualization libraries and visualization techniques help in building  insightful visualization easily.
    c. D3: Difficult to maintain if code is unstructured and without comments. 

3. Usability of visualization developed (for end users)
    - Visualization developed using Python, D3, and Tableau are highly usable depending on the consumers' needs. Python is good for static and scientific visualizations, Tableau could help in building dashboards for business analytics while D3 creates highly dynamic and customized visualization for thr web. 

4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
    a. Python: It requires external tools (Hadoop, AWS) to scale effeciently.
    b. Tableau: Have built-in data/web server features for scalability.
    c. D3: It needs web frameowrk to scale effectively.
   
5. System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing)(for end users)
    a. Python: Browser or OS
    b. Tableau: Licensed software or web browser(Tableau Public)
    c. D3: Browser
