Wins+Nominations vs IMdb Rating seems to be a better feature combination than Budget Vs IMDb
Rating for separating the classes. Visually, it is clearly visible in the scatter plot that
red circles are mostly scattered in the range of "0 to 20" of WinsNoms and "2.5 to 7.5" on 
the IMDb Rating axis. While in the Budget Vs IMDb Rating Scatterplot, the circles and crosses
are broadly scattered over the canvas which makes it difficult to separate the classes



Log Scale are mostly used when the data is continuous. It addresses the skewness towards large
values which are less frequent than the bulk of data.Like in the movies dataset, WinNoms varies
from 0 to 271 and there are only 15 values which are greater than 100 rest all are less than 100.
